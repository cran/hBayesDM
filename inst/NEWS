Dec 25, 2017 (0.5.0)
* Support variational Bayesian methods (vb=TRUE)
* Allow posterior predictive checks, except for drift-diffusion models (inc_postpred=TRUE)
* Add the peer influence task (Chung et al., 2015, USE WITH CAUTION for now and PLEASE GIVE US FEEDBACK!)
* Add 'prl_fictitious_rp' model 
* Made changes to be compatible with the newest Stan version (e.g., // instead of # for commenting). 
* In 'prl_*' models, 'rewlos' is replaced by 'outcome' so that column names and labels would be consistent across tasks as much as possible.
* Email feature is disabled as R mail package does not allow users to send anonymous emails anymore.
* When outputs are saved as a file (*.RData), the file name now contains the name of the data file.

May 20, 2017 (0.4.0)
* Add a choice reaction time task and evidence accumulation models 
  - Drift diffusion model (both hierarchical and single-subject)
  - Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model (both hierarchical and single-subject)
* Add PRL models that can fit multiple blocks
* Add single-subject versions for the delay discounting task (`dd_hyperbolic_single` and `dd_cs_single`).
* Standardize variable names across all models (e.g., `rewlos` --> `outcome` for all models)
* Separate versions for CRAN and GitHub. All models/features are identical but the GitHub version contains precompilled models.

Jan 22, 2017 (0.3.1)
* Remove dependence on the modeest package. Now use a built-in function to estimate the mode of a posterior distribution.
* Rewrite the "printFit" function.

Jan 20, 2017 (0.3.0)
* Made several changes following the guidelines for R packages providing interfaces to Stan. 
* Stan models are precompiled and models will run immediately when called. 
* The default number of chains is set to 4. 
* The default value of `adapt_delta` is set to 0.95 to reduce the potential for divergences.
* The “printFit” function uses LOOIC by default. Users can select WAIC or both (LOOIC & WAIC) if needed. 

Dec 28, 2016 (0.2.3.3)
1. Change
  * Add help files
  * Add a function for checking Rhat values (rhat). 
  * Change a link to its tutorial website

Dec 21, 2016 (0.2.3.2)
1. Change
  * Use wide normal distributions for unbounded parameters (gng_* models).
  * Automatic removal of rows (trials) containing NAs. 

Sep 29, 2016 (0.2.3.1)
1. Change
  * Add a function for plotting individual parameters (plotInd) 

Sat July 16 2016 (0.2.3)
1. Change
  * Add a new task: the Ultimatum Game
  * Add new models for the Probabilistic Reversal Learning and Risk Aversion tasks
  * ‘bandit2arm’ -> change its name to ‘bandit2arm_delta’. Now all model names are in the same format (i.e., TASK_MODEL).
  * Users can extract model-based regressors from gng_m* models
  * Include the option of customizing control parameters (adapt_delta, max_treedepth, stepsize)
  * ‘plotHDI’ function -> add ‘fontSize’ argument & change the color of histogram

Sat Apr 02 2016 (0.2.1)
1. Bug fixes 
  * All models: Fix errors when indPars=“mode”
  * ra_prospect model: Add description for column names of a data (*.txt) file
2. Change
  * Change standard deviations of ‘b’ and ‘pi’ priors in gng_* models
